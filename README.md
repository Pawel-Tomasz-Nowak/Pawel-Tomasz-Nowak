### 👋 Hi there, I'm [Pawel Nowak]!

I'm a **data enthusiast** fascinated by how mathematical concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems across various domains. Whether it's uncovering hidden insights in datasets or building predictive models, I love the power of data-driven decision-making.

### 🔍 What Drives Me:
I find it incredible how data, when paired with the right tools and techniques, can unlock answers to pressing questions in fields ranging from business to science. I enjoy diving deep into data analysis challenges, transforming raw numbers into actionable insights, and solving complex problems with a touch of creativity.

### 🧰 My Toolkit:
My go-to programming language is **Python**, and I’m continuously exploring its versatile libraries to tackle data analysis tasks. Here's what I frequently use:

- **Pandas & Polars** – for efficient data manipulation and wrangling.
- **Seaborn** – for turning data into beautiful, insightful visualizations.
- **Scikit-Learn** – to build machine learning models that predict, classify, and solve.
- **NumPy** – for powerful numerical operations on large datasets.

### 🚀 On My Learning Path:
I'm always excited to expand my knowledge and stay updated on the latest tools and techniques. Currently, I'm planning to dive into:

- **R Language** – to broaden my statistical analysis and data visualization skills.
- **Mojo Language** – a new and innovative programming language with potential to make data processing even faster and more efficient.
